It's been so long, a year since then.
Do you still remember our past?
We dashed ahead, I didn't know.
I see that it went really fast.
Here, deep in my memories,
I'm searching the unchanging you.
And until this point, here and now,
I'm waiting for you to break through.

I really badly want to see you once more.
Just for a moment, that is all I ask for.
I am not reaching you somewhere, oh so far.
You are my distant star.

I really badly want to see you right now.
And all the time we shared, but I wonder how.
Maybe it's just too late? 
Still I have a wish to send you.
Oh, please come true.</p>
