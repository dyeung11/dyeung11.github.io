    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Darren. I'm taking some classes in the LosRios district and building some more skills in CIS since I like programming and computers and other tech related stuff.</p>
    <p>Besides school, my hobbies include dabbling with tech, video games, art, and other programming stuff.</p>
    <p>I haven't done any professional work, but it's fun to play around with it.</p>
    <p>I'm an Asian-American and 1st generation, meaning my parents immigrated here and I was born here in America. I've lived in Sacramento all my life and I love it here.</p>
