    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Hello! Welcomes to Darren Yeung's Tech Hub- a place where I collect all of my experience in the tech field. None of it is professional work and is mainly just as 
        a hobby, but these skills can be applied in employment and personal benefit. If you have any suggestions for a tutorial, please feel free to email me or leave a comment
        in the contact section. Thank you and hope to see you again! 
    </p>
    <h2>Tech Industry</h2>
    <p>Interested in tech? Take a brief look at Treehouse's vidoe of "Who does What in the Tech Industry" to know more about the tech around us and how we can
        be a part of it. Tons of resources are out there available for us to learn. Try it out!
